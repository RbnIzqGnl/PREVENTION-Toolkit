# PREVENTION Dataset Toolkit
This toolkit allows you to import and visualize the PREVENTION dataset.
It provides some examples about how to use and understand the available information.

To generate the executable file you need to have installed the OpenCV library.

To build the executable file type the following:

`mkdir build && cd build`

`cmake ../`

`make`


To test the program type the following:

`./prevention-dataset <path to the RECORD/DRIVE directory>` e.g. `./prevention-dataset /tmp/RECORD1/DRIVE1/`


Use WASD to move forward and backward along the video.
Numbers from 1 to 5 (not in the numeric pad) enable/disable visual options.
