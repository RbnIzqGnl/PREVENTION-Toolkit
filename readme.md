To generate the executable file you need to have installed the OpenCV library.

To build the executable file type the following:

`mkdir build && cd build`

`cmake ../`

`make`


To test the program type the following:

`./prevention-dataset <path to the RECORD/DRIVE directory>` e.g. `./prevention-dataset /tmp/RECORD1/DRIVE1/`
